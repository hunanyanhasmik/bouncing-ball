# Bouncing Ball

## Description
Develop a web application using html5 canvas, where users can click on the screen to spawn a circle. This circle should realistically obey Earth-like gravity, moving vertically and bouncing upon hitting the bottom of the screen, with a dampening effect on each bounce until it comes to a stop. There can be multiple circle instances on screen at a time.

## Steps to compile
- Clone the repository
- In the terminal do `cd bouncing_ball/ts`
- Run `tsc script.ts`

## Steps to run
After compiling the project:
- Open `index.html` file using any browser
- Click on the screen to play in the opened browser tab
